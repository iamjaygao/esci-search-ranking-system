# Hybrid Search Reranking

Hybrid product search system combining keyword matching (BM25) and semantic understanding (Two-Tower BERT) with a learned reranker.

## What it does

User searches "running shoes for seniors" → returns the 48 most relevant products from 2.6M items.

## How it works

1. **BM25** - finds products containing the search words
2. **Two-Tower** - finds products with similar meaning (even without exact word matches)
3. **Merge** - combines both result sets
4. **Rerank** - neural network picks the best 48

## Why both?

| BM25 wins | Neural wins |
|-----------|-------------|
| "iPhone 15 Pro Max" | "gift for outdoorsy dad" |
| "SKU-12345" | "comfy WFH chair" |

## Tech stack

- BERT (embeddings)

## How to run

Everything is run from the project root. Follow these steps in order:

**Step 1 — Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 2 — Fine-tune the Two-Tower model** (only needed once)
```bash
python scripts/train_two_tower.py
```
This trains the semantic encoder on ESCI data and saves weights to `models/two_tower_finetuned/`.

**Step 3 — Generate retrieval scores** (only needed once, or when data changes)
```bash
python scripts/generate_bm25_scores.py
python scripts/generate_two_tower_scores.py
```
These produce `output/bm25_scores_{split}.csv` and `output/two_tower_scores_{split}.csv` for train and test.

**Step 4 — Build search indices** (only needed once)
```bash
python scripts/build_indices.py
```
Pre-computes BM25 and FAISS indices for fast retrieval at search time.

**Step 5 — Train the reranker**
```bash
python scripts/train_reranker.py
```
Trains the neural reranker using the scores from Step 3. Saves the best model to `output/best_esci_reranker.pth`.

**Step 6 — Evaluate**
```bash
python evaluation/evaluate_retrieval.py
python evaluation/evaluate_reranker.py
```
Prints NDCG@10 and Recall@K for the retrieval baselines and the reranker.

**Step 7 — Run the full pipeline** (optional)
```bash
python scripts/run_pipeline.py
```

**Try an interactive search** (requires Steps 2-5 completed)
```bash
python tests/test_custom_search.py
```
Type a query and see ranked results from the full pipeline.

## Tests

Run from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m tests.test_two_tower
```

The test suite validates the two-tower retrieval logic against a small synthetic dataset without requiring real data or GPU. It checks:

- **Output shape** — result contains exactly the three expected columns (`query_id`, `item_id`, `two_tower_score`)
- **No empty results** — the function returns at least one row
- **Score normalization** — all scores are in [0, 1]
- **Query coverage** — every query in the input appears in the output
- **Item coverage** — every item in the input appears in the output
- **Semantic relevance** — the model ranks semantically relevant items higher than irrelevant ones (e.g. "running shoes" scores higher than "coffee maker" for a running shoes query)
- **No duplicates** — each item appears only once per query
- **Input validation** — passing a dataframe with missing required columns raises a `ValueError`

## Recent restructuring

The project folder structure was reorganized to make navigation easier. No logic was changed — only file locations and imports.

### What moved where

| Old location | New location | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `signals/bm25.py`, `signals/two_tower.py` | `retrieval/bm25.py`, `retrieval/two_tower.py` | "Signals" was vague — these are retrieval modules |
| `signals/generate_bm25_scores.py` | `scripts/generate_bm25_scores.py` | Runnable scripts belong together |
| `signals/generate_two_tower_scores.py` | `scripts/generate_two_tower_scores.py` | Same |
| `signals/train_two_tower.py` | `scripts/train_two_tower.py` | Same |
| `main.py` | `scripts/run_pipeline.py` | Keep root clean, scripts in one place |
| `build_search_engine_indices.py` | `scripts/build_indices.py` | Same |
| `query_complexity_metric/` | `analysis/` | Shorter name, added `__init__.py` |

### `baseline_reranker.py` split into `reranking/`

The 317-line monolith contained the model class, feature extraction, dataset class, and training loop all in one file. It's now three files:

- **`reranking/model.py`** — `DeepESCIReranker` class (single source of truth)
- **`reranking/features.py`** — `extract_esci_features()` + `PairwiseESCIDataset`
- **`scripts/train_reranker.py`** — the training loop

`DeepESCIReranker` was previously copy-pasted in `baseline_reranker.py`, `evaluation/evaluate_reranker.py`, and `tests/test_custom_search.py`. Now they all import from `reranking.model`.

### Import cleanup

- All `from signals.` imports updated to `from retrieval.`
- Old relative imports (e.g. `from bm25 import`, `from metrics import`) changed to absolute (e.g. `from retrieval.bm25 import`, `from evaluation.metrics import`)
- `sys.path` hacks standardized and placed before project imports in every file that needs them
